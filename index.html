                        <div>
                            <p>I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science at the University of 
                                Kansas under the School of Engineering. In addition to majoring in CS, 
                                I am also a Residential Assistant for the Self Hall Dormitory. During the 
                                2018 summer, I had the amazing opportunity to intern at Express Scripts 
                                as a Programmer Analyst where I gained valuable experience with ReactJS 
                                and reinforced my front end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) skillset. Now, 
                                during my Sophomore summer, I am currently interning at AT&T in the Tech 
                                Development program. I have had the opportunity to learn IOS development, 
                                Python web development using Flask and Django, Angular, MS SQL, and 
                                continued to reinforce my front end skillset.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I go to work each day, I am most passionate about solving new 
                                problems, increasing my knowledge, and most importantly building new 
                                relationships. I enjoy working with groups whose goal it is to improve 
                                the lives of those around them through new innovative solutions. I am 
                                currently looking for new internship opportunities for my upcoming summer 
                                where I can begin to dive into Data Science concepts such as machine 
                                learning, neural networks, artificial intelligence, etc. If you know of 
                                any opportunities or are a hiring manager, please email me or contact 
                                me on LinkedIn.
